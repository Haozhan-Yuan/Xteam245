"Classic Solitaire Game"

Solitaire is a single-player game in which a player sorts cards into 'piles' based upon their suit and value. The objective is to eventually sort all cards into a pile, thereby completing the game.

Our application will uses a series of classes representing the different piles of cards in a solitaire game. These utilize a base Pile class, which the additional classes extend, as well as a Card class which models cards and provides information on their suit, value, and current status.

The GUI of this program will provided players with a visually pleasing interface for the game.
